# surfagent (trading-essentials fork)

> Fork of [AllAboutAI-YT/surfagent](https://github.com/AllAboutAI-YT/surfagent) with extensions for trading-stack workflows. See [PHASE-1-CHANGES.md](./PHASE-1-CHANGES.md) for what this fork adds.

**Browser automation API for AI agents.** Give any AI agent the ability to see, navigate, and interact with real web pages through Chrome.

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tkDIdH62yq8/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkDIdH62yq8)

`npm install -g surfagent` — two commands to give your agent a browser.

**surfagent** connects to a local Chrome browser via CDP and exposes a simple HTTP API that returns structured page data — every interactive element, form field, link, and CSS selector — so AI agents can navigate websites fast and precisely without screenshots or trial-and-error.

**Works with any AI agent framework:** LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, Claude Code, OpenAI Agents, custom agents — anything that can make HTTP calls.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g surfagent
surfagent start
```

A **new Chrome window** opens with debug mode — your personal Chrome is not affected. The API starts on `http://localhost:3456`.

## Why surfagent?

| Without surfagent | With surfagent |
|---|---|
| Agent takes screenshots, sends to vision model | Agent calls `/recon`, gets structured JSON in 30ms |
| Guesses CSS selectors, fails, retries | Gets exact selectors from recon response |
| Can't read forms, dropdowns, or modals | Gets form schemas with labels, types, required flags |
| Breaks on SPAs, iframes, shadow DOM | Handles all of them out of the box |
| Slow (2-5s per screenshot round-trip) | Fast (20-60ms per API call on existing tabs) |

## How Agents Use It

The workflow is: **recon → act → read**.

```
1. POST /recon   → get the page map (selectors, forms, elements)
2. POST /click   → click something using a selector from step 1
   POST /fill    → fill a form using selectors from step 1
3. POST /read    → check what happened (success? error? new content?)
4. POST /recon   → if the page changed, map it again
```

### Example: search on any website

```bash
# 1. Recon the page — find the search input
curl -X POST localhost:3456/recon -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tab":"0"}'
# Response includes: { "selector": "input[name='search']", "text": "Search..." }

# 2. Type and submit
curl -X POST localhost:3456/fill -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tab":"0", "fields":[{"selector":"input[name=\"search\"]","value":"AI agents"}], "submit":"enter"}'

# 3. Read the results
curl -X POST localhost:3456/read -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tab":"0"}'
```

## All Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/recon` | POST | Full page map — every element, form, selector, heading, nav link, metadata, captcha detection |
| `/read` | POST | Structured page content — headings, tables, code blocks, notifications, result areas |
| `/fill` | POST | Fill form fields with real CDP keystrokes (works with React, Vue, SPAs) |
| `/click` | POST | Click by selector or text, including dropdown options. Optional `waitAfter` for SPAs |
| `/dismiss` | POST | Auto-dismiss cookie banners, consent dialogs, modals (multi-language) |
| `/scroll` | POST | Scroll page, returns visible content preview and scroll position |
| `/navigate` | POST | Go to URL, back, or forward in the same tab |
| `/eval` | POST | Run JavaScript in any tab or cross-origin iframe |
| `/dispatch` | POST | Dispatch DOM events (`submit`, `click`, `keydown`…) for React/Vue/Angular SPAs; `reactDebug` to inspect handlers |
| `/captcha` | POST | Detect and interact with captchas — Arkose, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha (experimental) |
| `/type` | POST | Raw CDP key typing without clearing — for Google Sheets, contenteditable, canvas apps |
| `/label` | POST | Set a durable tab handle (stored as `window.name`) — survives navigation + daemon restart |
| `/screenshot` | POST | Capture a tab as base64 PNG/JPEG (`fullPage`, `format`, `quality` options) |
| `/focus` | POST | Bring a tab to the front in Chrome |
| `/tabs` | GET | List all open Chrome tabs (includes durable `label`) |
| `/health` | GET | Check if Chrome and API are connected |

Full API reference with request/response schemas: **[API.md](./API.md)**

## Key Features

**Page reconnaissance** — one call returns every interactive element with stable CSS selectors, form schemas with field labels and validation, navigation structure, metadata, and content summary.

**Real keyboard input** — fills forms using CDP `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`, not JavaScript value injection. Works with React, Vue, Angular, and any framework-controlled inputs.

**Cross-origin iframe support** — target iframes by domain (`"tab": "stripe.com"`). CDP connects to them as separate targets, bypassing same-origin restrictions.

**SPA navigation** — handles single-page apps (YouTube, Gmail, Google Flights). Enter key submission, client-side routing, dynamic content — all work.

**Captcha detection** — `/recon` automatically detects captcha iframes (Arkose, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha) and flags them. `/captcha` endpoint provides basic interaction.

**Overlay detection** — modals, cookie banners, and blocking overlays are detected and reported so agents can dismiss them before interacting.

**Same-tab navigation** — links with `target="_blank"` are automatically opened in the same tab instead of spawning new ones.

## Tab Targeting

Every endpoint accepts a `tab` field. Resolution order: index → exact id → label → substring.

```json
{"tab": "0"}           // by index
{"tab": "btc-chart"}   // a label set via POST /label (most durable — prefer this)
{"tab": "github"}      // partial match on URL or title
{"tab": "stripe.com"}  // matches cross-origin iframes too
```

Labels are the most durable handle — set one with `POST /label` and it survives reloads and daemon restarts. If a substring matches more than one tab, the API returns `409 {code: "AMBIGUOUS_TAB", matches: [...]}` instead of guessing — pick a candidate id and retry, or label the tab.

## Commands

```bash
surfagent start     # Start Chrome + API (one command)
surfagent chrome    # Start Chrome debug session only
surfagent api       # Start API only (Chrome must be running)
surfagent health    # Check if everything is running
surfagent help      # Show all options
```

**Flags** (apply to `start` / `chrome`):

```bash
surfagent start --headless              # run Chrome headless (or HEADLESS=true)
surfagent start --profile demo          # named, isolated profile under ~/.surfagent/profiles
surfagent start --port 3457 --cdp-port 9223   # custom API + CDP ports for parallel daemons
```

Named profiles keep their own session state (cookies are only copied from your system Chrome on first run of the unnamed default profile). Combine `--profile` with `--port`/`--cdp-port` to run isolated daemons side by side.

## Tested On

Google Flights, YouTube, GitHub, Supabase, Hacker News, Reddit, CodePen, Polymarket, npm — including autocomplete dropdowns, date pickers, complex forms, SPA navigation, cross-origin iframes, and captchas.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | Fully supported |
| Linux | Fully supported |
| Windows | Not yet supported — coming soon |

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Chrome or any Chromium-based browser (Arc, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, etc.)
- Node.js 18+

### Using a non-Chrome browser

surfagent detects Chrome by default. For other Chromium-based browsers, set `BROWSER_PATH`:

```bash
# Arc
BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Arc.app/Contents/MacOS/Arc" surfagent start

# Brave
BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser" surfagent start

# Microsoft Edge
BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge" surfagent start
```
